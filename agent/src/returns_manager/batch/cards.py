"""Synthesizes an in-memory ProductCardV1 straight from a batch "before" row's own given
data (parts_list, sku, asin, category). Nothing is invented by a model here: every field
comes directly from the seller-supplied CSV or a documented synthetic default (price/
recovery-rate placeholders, same convention as `reference/reference/onboarding.py`'s
draft cards). The card is never written to `reference/products/`; it exists only for the
duration of one batch run.
