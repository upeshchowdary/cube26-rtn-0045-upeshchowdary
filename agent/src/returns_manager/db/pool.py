"""Connection pool for the application role and the fail-safe boot check (§6.2).

The API, worker, MCP server and CLI connect as `rm_app_login`. Before serving anything they run
`assert_safe_role`: if the connected role is a superuser, has BYPASSRLS, or can become (is a member of)
any role that is, or can act as the schema owner or the definer role, the process refuses to start.
A green isolation test under a bypass role would prove nothing.
